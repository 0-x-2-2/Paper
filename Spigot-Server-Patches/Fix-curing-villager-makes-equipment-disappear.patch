Subject: [PATCH] Fix curing villager makes equipment disappear

This fixes the CB bug where curing a villager that is holding
equipment (weapons/armor) causes the items to disappear instead of drop
to the ground by forcing the items to drop instead of going to the drops
field for the EntityDeathEvent which does not fire for entity conversions.
