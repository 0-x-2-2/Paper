Subject: [PATCH] Log exceptions thrown during chat processing

Previously the async chat executor service would take chat handling
using the #submit method, which wraps the logic in a future task.
The future takes full ownership of the task, including any potential
exception, meaning that the uncaught exception handler never gets
notified about potential exceptions thrown during async chat logic.

As the chat task does neither need to be cancelled nor returns something
required later on, this commit moves from #submit to #execute, skipping
any future task creation. This properly propagates any exception upwards
to the worker thread in the executor service, allowing the server to
catch and properly log the exception to the console.
